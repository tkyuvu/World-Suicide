        <h2>Who is at risk?</h2>
            <h3>General Information</h3>
                <p>
                1. In general, suicide rate of 43 countries decreased from 1995 to 2013. With the decrease in suicide rate, Russia and Hungary are still the top countries over the years.<br> 
                2. Men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide than women.<br>
                3. Suicide happens more in older people and older generations.</p>

            <h3>Impacts of Social and Economic Factors on Suicide</h3>
                <p>It is not easy to identify the effects of social and economic factors on suicide rate. The data in this analysis does not support a consistent evidence for relationships between the contributing factors and suicide rate. 
                Despite of the weak correlations, we can still determine some trends and identify the groups of people who are at higher risk of committing suicide as follow: </p>

                <table>
                <caption>Table 1. Summary of Socioeconomic Impact on Suicide Rate</caption>
                    <tr>

                        <th>Suicide Rate</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            Higher Alcohol Consumption<br>

                            Higher expense<br>
                            Lower compensation from work<br>
                            Higher unemployment rate<br>
                        </td>
                        <td>Increase</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            Higher Life Expectancy<br>
                            Higher number of physicians<br>
                            Higher education completion rate<br>
                            Higher GDP Per Capita
                        </td>
                        <td>Decrease</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>These correlations are weak. Additionally, correlation does not mean causation. Therefore, these factors cannot be determined as the causes of suicide. 
                Suicide depends on multiple factors. A single factor alone cannot be the reason that lead to suicide. However, if someone has signs of overcoming multiple changes in life, 
                with the suggested socio-economic factors above, that person is at high risk of commiting suicide.
                At least, we are able to identify people at risk. Moreover, we are more concerned about those who experience a combination of contributing factors listed above.
                </p>
            
        
        <h2>Prevention</h2>         
            <p>Once we identify vulnerable groups, we can take action to provide support and prevention. There are many things that can be done to prevent suicides:<br>
            1. Raise awareness and establish support network in community.<br>
            2. Schools can incoporate with families to create meaningful and healthy activities for students and teach them both the goods and bads from technology.<br>
            3. Increase the use of crisis hotline.<br>
            4. Introduce alcohol policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.<br>
            5. Collaborating care and mental health screening at general hospitals and nursing homes.<br>
