        <p>There might be an association between the quality of life and suicide rate. Will healthcare have any effects on suicide? 
        How about technology? Nowadays, interactions over the internet and cell phones also pose a risk of cyberbullying that some people have to face. 
        We are going to explore the relationships between suicide rate and the following social factors:
            <li>Life Expectancy</li><br>
            <li>Alcohol Consumption</li><br>
            <li>Number of Physicians</li><br>
            <li>Technology</li><br>
            <li>Lower Education Completion</li><br>
        </p>
        <p>Scatter plots are used mostly in showing correlations and the impacts on suicide rate, but some scatter plots for some variables in this analysis do not 
        show any trend or correlations, so it is better to look into the association between two variables instead of finding correlations. Because of this reason, 
        various type of visualization charts such as trend line, combo chart, and bubble chart with animation will be used as well in order 
        to show the relationships between suicide rate and social factors.</p>

        <p>Users can toggle between different social factors to examine the impact of these factors on suicide rate.

		<p>From the animated chart, the bubbles are moving towards the bottom right corner, meaning that suicide rate dropped as life expectancy increased. 
        There was one country that behaved oddly when its life expectancy decreased from 1995 to 2005, then started to pick up in 2006. That country is 
        South Africa. South Africa has a lower life expectancy than the rest of the world due to infectious diseases and violence. The reason for the 
        drop in life expectancy of South Africa in 1995 - 2005 was HIV-AIDS epidemic. After HIV treatments became available in 2005, South Africa's 
        life expectancy started to rise again. <br>
        Except for South Africa, most countries' suicide rates dropped when life expectancy increased. We can say that there is a negative relationship between 
        suicide rate and life expectancy.
        </p>		

        <h2>Number of Physicians</h2>
        
        <p>The number of physicians increases by years, which means patients can have a better care in both mental and physical health. 
        Therefore, suicide rate decreases when there are more healthcare workers.
        </p>


		<h2>Alcohol Consumption</h2>
        
        <p>The correlation between suicide rate and alcohol consumption is relatively strong. The positive trend is obviously seen in the chart. 
        Studies have shown that  alcohol is a major contributing factor in suicide. While it is impossible to narrow down the reasons people commit 
        suicide, the abuse of alcohol is found to be related to nearly one-third of suicides. Alcohol is somewhat a "medication" people seek for 
        when they suffer from anxiety. This substance may ease their mind at first, but the prolong use of alcohol can lead to strong suicidal thought. 
        Additionally, alcohol generally makes the other contributing factors become worse. For example, alcohol can cause problems for someone who is 
        dealing with depression and family/work issues, then they develope suicidal thought under alcohol influence.
        </p>

        
        <h2>Technology (Internet and Cell Phone Usage) </h2>
    
        <p>With the development in technology, more people (especially teenagers and young alduts) spend more time on the Internet and smart phones.
        Although the correlations in the charts above are weak, we can still see a positive trend for cell phone and internet usage. 
        Heavy technology use and social media are key factors that change the habit of communication. There are plenty of information and influences 
        on social media, both the good and the bad, but people's mental health are being affected by insulting comments or violent videos.
        </p>

        <h2>Secondary Education Completion</h2>
        
        <p>When looking at the trends from 1995 to 2013, there was a slight increase in secondary completion rate over the years and  
        suicide rate decreased over years. This suggests that there is an association between education completion rate and suicide rate. 
        Higher education completion is associated with lower suicide rate.
