# World-Suicide
Data Visualization - World Suicide From 1995 To 2013

## Introduction
Every year, there are about 800,000 people die from suicide and there are many more people who attempt to suicide. 
Suicide is a tragedy that affects families, friends, and communities. The cause of suicide is very complicated, but it has been suggested 
that a combination of changes in life events can affect mental and emotional health, leading to suicide.

This project aims to analyze suicide data to gain a better understanding of social and economic factors that contribute to suicide. 
The ultimate goal is to raise awareness and provide support in preventing suicide. The raw data used in this analysis is obtained 
from Kaggle and World Bank Data. Data selection and cleanup is done in Jupyter Notebook and Excel. The clean data contains data for 43 
countries from 1995 to 2013.

## Visualization
The visualizations are created using Tableau Desktop and implemented in HTML webpage. This is the link to the webpage https://tkyuvu.github.io/World-Suicide/

## Key Findings
Here are some interesting findings from the analysis:

 - Men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide than women.
 - Older people have higher suicide rates.
 - Suicide rate increases with higher alcohol consumption, unemployment rate, heavy use of Internet and cell phones, higher expense, lower compensation from work, lower GDP per capita, lower education completion rate, lower number of physicians, and lower life expectancy.

We can identify people have high risk of suicide based on the key findings above and provide support to prevent suicide.
